### About the author

The author is currently an undergraduate physics student in Brazil.

### About the blog

The blog was created for me to talk about natural science and math. I intent to make some series of posts explaining complex, or seen as complex, themes.

I will probably post my reports on topics I am studying and unrelated stuff that I feel like posting as well.

### About the name

Urca is a physical process that happens in neutron star. It was discovered by Russian and Brazilian physicists George Gamow and Mário Schenberg, which named it after the Urca Casino at Urca neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro. According to Schenberg "the energy disappears in the nucleus of the supernova as quickly as the money disappeared at that roulette table". The word also sounded like "robber" in Russian to Gamow.

I chose it to name the blog because it sounded cool and Mário was born at the same city as me.
